# Monopoly: Vancouver Housing Market 

## üè´ BCIT COMP4959 Project


  ‚ú® Ever dreamed of owning property in Vancouver? ‚ú®

  Play **Vancouver Housing Market** with your friends and live out your real estate fantasies.

  Without the crushing mortgage, you'll start with $1,500, which is enough to buy several properties and a bucket of bluberries *just like our grandparents*!

  Buy up propertie**s** without a down payment, charge rent, and send your misbehaving buddies to jail... where there‚Äôs actually enough room to hold them.

  **Vancouver Housing Market** is inpired by the classic board game Monopoly, with an Elixir/Phoenix implementation.

  Now it‚Äôs your turn to make your dream come true‚Äîown your favourite neighbourhood!
