          - You may purchase the utility if it is not owned.
          - If it is owned, you must pay 4 times your dice roll to the owner if they own only that utility. If they own both, you must pay 10 times your dice roll.

        - If jailed by an effect, player can escape by: 
          - Paying the fine ($50)
          - Rolling doubles on any of the three turns in jail. Move forward using the result, but the player doesn‚Äôt get an extra throw.
          - Using a ‚ÄòGet out of jail free‚Äô card (drawn from either card pile)
        - Player WILL leave the jail after the third throw and pay the fine if the third throw is not a double.
