integration plan:

piece-by-piece starting in order from what the player interacts with from entering website to game completion

handle testing with at least 2 players, ideally 4
open up 2~4 browsers to load up the players

( ) player can set a name
( ) each player can join the game
	(x) when a new player joins, all views update to show new players in lobby
( ) a player can leave the lobby
	( ) if a player leaves, all views are updated to show player's id being gong
( ) each player's piece is handled
( ) game start (whether automatically, start from first/any player, or ready up from all players)

( ) turn start for first player
	( ) other players cannot act
	( ) other players' dashboards don't update (only current player's)
( ) first player rolls
	( ) all players see updated position of first player
	( ) don't handle logic for landing on specific locations yet
( ) first player ends turn, game successfully updates to start the next player (loop back to turn start)

once looping through player list is complete:
( ) add handling of landing on a property
	( ) test player buy
	( ) test auction (if there's auctioning)
( )
